# NOTE: Do NOT ignore dist/ if you plan to deploy this on Streamlit Community Cloud.
# Streamlit Cloud often does not have Node/npm available at runtime, so committing a prebuilt
# ./dist is the simplest way to make the app publicly accessible.
# If you prefer not to commit dist/, re-add it here and set CROWDLIKE_REMOTE_FRONTEND_URL instead.
